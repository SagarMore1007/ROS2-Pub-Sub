Publisher: A publisher node is responsible for broadcasting data or messages onto a specific topic. Topics act as communication channels where publishers publish messages that contain information relevant to the topic.
Subscriber: A subscriber node is designed to receive messages published on a particular topic. Subscribers express their interest in specific topics by subscribing to them. For example, a navigation algorithm might subscribe to the "/camera/image" topic to receive images for obstacle detection.
